# RTOS_simple_project_atmega32

The FreeRTOS-Based LED Toggling project demonstrates the use of FreeRTOS on an Atmega32 microcontroller to control two LEDs. The LEDs are programmed to blink at different intervals (500ms and 2000ms) using task scheduling provided by FreeRTOS. This project showcases the multitasking capabilities of FreeRTOS, allowing for precise control over LED toggling timings in a real-time embedded system.
